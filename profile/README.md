# Data 6

This foundational Data Science course combines inferential and computational thinking as applied to the fundamentals of quantitative social inquiry. 
Apply critical concepts and skills in computer programming to conduct quantitative social science research in various contexts, including economic 
outcomes, public health, environmental justice, privacy, bioethics, and social networks. Understand the process of using data for quantitative analysis
and how to develop a variety of figures, combined with text, to communicate their findings. The focus is on data exploration and identifying patterns 
relevant to social concepts, rather than inferences and predictions. The course can serve as a precursor to [Data 8: Foundations of Data Science](https://www.data8.org/).
